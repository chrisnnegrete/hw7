Midterm Mini Project: NCC-1701

Essentially, this program allows you to fly the USS Enterprise around the canvas in space. The canvas has a transparency in its color profile which allows the Enterprise to have a motion-blur effect when it's moving, in addition to making the various stars appear and disappear randomly. Sound effects from the 2009 film underscore the background noise while the left, right and up arrow keys control the vessel's movement.
