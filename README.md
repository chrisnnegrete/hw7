Midterm Mini Project: NCC-1701

Essentially, this program allows you to fly the USS Enterprise around the canvas in space. The canvas has a transparency in its color profile which allows the Enterprise to have a motion-blur effect when it's moving, in addition to making the various stars appear and disappear randomly. Sound effects from the 2009 film underscore the background noise while the left, right and up arrow keys control the vessel's movement.

Important notes:

Instead of having a separate file for the stars, I ended up having them drawn in the same sketch so they move with the ship when it moves. Since the stars are just points, there is no way to tell their orientation, unless their position exceeds that of the width/height of the canvas. 

Due to a lack of time and midterms colliding in my schedule, this game remains incomplete at the moment. The initial plan was to have the Enterprise be able to intercept Klingons, which attack from around the canvas and are naturally attracted to the position of the ship. However, because I was unable to finish the second part in time, the project is in a state where I have met the requirements for the midterm project, though I hoped to do more.
